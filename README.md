## Open Source

Both the Testing Pathways website and the pathways contained within it are open source. This is very important to us, we want this project to be run by the testing community, to help the wider testing community grow and improve.  It should be noted that the content the pathways direct you to isn't within our control and also isn't open source, only the pathway itself. 

## What is a Testing Pathway

You can think of learning pathways as a guide, a trusted list of educational content links, where you are guided through them with the puprpose of each link building upon the lessons taught in the previous links.

learning is broken up into bite sized chunks, gathering together the best free and affordable learning resources from all over the internet. 

You get to choose the path thats right for you, giving you the empowerment you need to upskill and shine as a test engineer and quality embassador. 

## Free First

We take every effort to guide to free content first and foremost as we want good testing training to be available to everyone.  Adding links to high quality and useful paid content is also ok, but always add free options first.

## Get Started Learning

Visit [Testing Pathways Website](http://www.testingpathways.com) and pick the pathway that suits you

## How to Contribute

We're always looking for talented testers to add to the curriculum.  

- Have you written a good tutorial or guide online?  Then please feel free to add it to one of our pathways if you think it will enhance a learners journey and experience.  
- Have you recently learned something new?  Why not document what you found the most useful and add it to one of our pathways.
- Do you train junior staff at work?  Then please, come and share your knowledge here too.

### Design and development principles:

1. Link to free content first, adding high quality paid content only as a secondary alternative to further the learners education
2. Use the pathways template
3. Make the content fun and friendly to follow
4. Make the content shine

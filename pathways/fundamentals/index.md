This is where it all starts, getting you familiar with the basic concepts you'll need to know as a test engineer.
If you already know some of the subjects, then feel free to skip ahead to the ones you need to learn.

A lot of the information in this fundamentals section has been taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), another open source learning website, aimed at developers, however a lot of the fundamentals are the same.

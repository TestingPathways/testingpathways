## Introduction

This website uses a series of learning pathways to teach you how to become a test engineer.  You can think of learning pathways as a form of roadmap, guiding you through a series of learning resources, found all over the internet.
We take the best learning resources which come in a variety of formats, from YouTube videos to Reference Manuals to blog and even books.  You can learn at your own pace and take the path which best suits your leaning needs.

We didn't want to re-create a comprehensive set of training lessons, that's already been done many times. What we have done is group together all of the best free resources, presenting them to you in a set of learning pathways. You decide which pathway to take.

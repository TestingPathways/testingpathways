# Your Career in Testing Starts Here

Community driven, open source, learning pathways which guide you at your own pace.  Whether you're just starting out, or wanting to add to your existing skills and level up, there's a learning journey for you.

This project was started by a tester, collaboratively created and built up by testers and with the sole purpose of helping testers get a free and good education, guided from a central location, with the support of a diverse testing community behind you. 

We are Open Source at our core, the website is hosted on GitHub pages, using an open source template. The curriculum is also open source and can be contributed to by anyone (pending quality approval).  So if you don't find what you're looking for, then either ask in the community and we'll try and create it as and when we can or you can go on the learning journey yourself and docement it on here as you learn so others can benefit from your experience.

# How to Contribute

We're always looking for talented testers to add to the curriculum.

- Have you written a good tutorial or guide online? Then please feel free to add it to one of our pathways if you think it will enhance a learners journey and experience.
- Have you recently learned something new? Why not document what you found the most useful and add it to one of our pathways.
- Do you train junior staff at work? Then please, come and share your knowledge here too.
- Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/TestingPathways/testingpathways. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct.

## Submitting code changes:

- Submit an Issue to motivate someone to update a guided path
- Discuss the proposed changes with others on the Slack Community
- Open a Pull Request to add changes to the pathways
- Ensure all CI tests pass
- Await code review to ensure the high quality of your change / addition to the pathway content

## Design and development principles:

- Link to free content first, adding high quality paid content only as a secondary alternative to further the learners education
- Use the pathways template
- Make the content fun and friendly to follow
- Make the content shine
